Excited to share my latest web development project where I'm diving into 3D physics with Cannon.js for the first time! Using React and Three.js, I've created a fun and interactive scene that showcases dynamic physics in the browser. Check out how the integration of 3D physics brings new depth and interactivity to the web!
